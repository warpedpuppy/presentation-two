1) unify pile to slot and pile to pile
2) change active card to object


IF MOVE MULTIPLE CARDS TO A MARKER IT COLLAPSES THEM


presentation notes:

1) canvas functioning illustration

2) array shuffle illustration

3) illustrate that even though imported into several pages -- same object

4) take them through definitions (flipPile, drawPile, etc.)

5) illustrate point rectangle hit collision /  rectangle rectangle hit collision

6) colon syntax: let { x, y, _index: pileKey, slot, marker} = target;

7) casting

8) point out why I use for v forEach -- because I want a return statement to shut it down



step-one: make image, give x y, put it on canvas;
step-two: card class
